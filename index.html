            Practice dribbling the ball. Dribbling is controlling the ball while running. If you want to keep the ball in your team's possession, you're going to need to dribble well. Dribbling is all about touching the ball strong enough to carry it forward, but light enough so that it stays at your feet.[1]
            You can dribble with the inside of your foot, above the toe (with the foot pointed down toward the ground), and even with the outside of your foot. The easiest way to dribble for beginners is probably with the inside of your foot.
            Learn to dribble at different speeds. When you're running down the sideline and you've beaten your defender, your dribbling will look a lot different from when you're taking on a defender head-on.

            Work on your passing skills. Passing is all about putting the ball exactly where you want it. In order to pass a soccer ball, kick the ball using the inside of your foot. This will give you less power but more accuracy. Once you master the basic pass, you can then try to slice and hook the ball in order to pass it to one of your teammates.[2]
            Anticipate where a player is going to be. If your teammate is running, always kick the ball ahead of them so that they can run to the ball in stride.
            To hook the ball, use the inside of your foot but turn it more forward (a 45-degree angle toward your target instead of closer to 90 degrees) as you strike the ball.
            Slicing takes a bit more practice since you need to strike the ball with the outside of your foot while your leg sweeps in a hooking motion.
            Tip: Pass with your toes pointed upward and your heel pointed down.

            Hone your shooting skills. If you're really close to the goal and all you need is accuracy, you can shoot using the sweet spot of the inside of your foot, like a pass. Normally, though, you're going to be farther away and will need power as well as accuracy.[3]
            Hit the ball to the left of the middle laces of your shoe, with your foot pointed down at the ground. Keep your foot pointed down at the ground as you follow through.
            Use your hips to swing through the ball. Bring your foot across your body if necessary to generate even more power. This should cause both feet to lift from the ground.

            Expert Trick: When you're practicing dribbling the ball in soccer, set up two small goals facing each other. Then, as you're kicking the ball, have someone else try to get the ball away from you. That way, you'll have practice changing directions, and you'll have to come up with solutions on how to find the open goal.

            Build your skills as a defender. Defending the goal from an opposing attacker is an underrated achievement. There are 3 basic things that you need to remember when guarding a player in soccer:[4]
            Don’t be fooled if your opponent starts and stops with the ball, fakes one way before heading the other, or tries other feints, tricks, or jukes. Instead, keep your eye on the ball at all times.
            Stay in between the ball and the goal. In other words, don't let the ball get behind you.
            Right after an attacker hits the ball on the dribble—that's the time when you should step in and either tackle or kick the ball toward an open teammate. This is called anticipating the dribble, and it's essential for knocking the ball from an attacking player.</p>

            <h3>What is the origin of football?</h3>
            <p> Modern football originated in Britain in the 19th century. Though “folk football” had been played since medieval times with varying rules, the game began to be standardized when it was taken up as a winter game at public schools.  antiquity outside Europe. The modern rules of association football are based on the mid-19th century efforts to standardise the widely varying forms of football played in the public schools of Britain. The history of football in Britain dates back to at least the eighth century CE. The development of modern-day association football has its origins in medieval ball games and English public school games. The modern game of association football originated with mid-nineteenth century efforts between local football clubs to standardize the varying sets of rules, culminating in formation of The Football Association in London, England in 1863. The rules drafted by the association allowed clubs to play each other without dispute, and specifically banned both handling of the ball (except by goalkeepers) and hacking during open field play. After the fifth meeting of the association a schism emerged between association football and the rules played by the Rugby school, later to be called rugby football. Football has been an Olympic sport ever since the second modern Summer Olympic Games in 1900.</p>
